This repository contains the full software we developed to control a PCB which is designed and created by our professor Martijn Oldenburg. The authors who worked on this project are Youri Klaassens, Tim Blank and Thomas Jansema. 


The requirements of the client were:
* The rotary encoder must be read by the microcontroller in order to switch input port.
* The potentiometer must be read by the microcontroller in order to set the volume.
* The microcontroller should trigger when the infrared receiver generates pulses. A result is to set the volume remotely.
* The microcontroller need to inform an user by writing relevant characters to the display.
